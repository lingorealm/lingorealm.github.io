    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics and Database:</strong> Lingo Realm uses Firebase to collect and store game playing statistics and to construct leaderboards. Data logged includes the name of the played game, player identifier, number of hearts, purchase operations, ad interactions, and play times. This information is used solely to improve your gaming experience, analyze app usage, and manage in-app transactions.</li>
  </ul>
